## How to Use

* On the left side we have the burgers that haven't been eaten.
* On the right side we have the burgers that have been eaten.
* On the button there is a form where you can add a new burger.
* Whenever you add a new burger it will display on the left side.
* If you click on one of the burgers on the left it means that you eat it.
* Then the burger that you ate displays on the right side.
